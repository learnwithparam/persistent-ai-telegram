# Building Persistent AI Assistants with Telegram

![learnwithparam.com](https://www.learnwithparam.com/ai-bootcamp/opengraph-image)

Start with a 20-line Telegram bot and incrementally add sessions, personality, tools, permissions, multi-channel gateway, context compaction, long-term memory, scheduling, and multi-agent routing.

## Workshop Modules

| # | Module | Core Addition | Key Insight | Lines |
|---|--------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| 01 | [Simplest Bot](./01-simplest-bot/) | Telegram + Anthropic API | An AI bot is just an API call wrapped in a message handler | ~20 |
| 02 | [Persistent Sessions](./02-persistent-sessions/) | JSONL per-user storage | JSONL is the simplest crash-safe persistence format | ~80 |
| 03 | [Personality & Soul](./03-personality-soul/) | System prompt + SOUL.md | The system prompt IS the agent's identity | ~90 |
| 04 | [Tools & Agent Loop](./04-tools-agent-loop/) | 4 tools + agent loop | The agent loop turns a chatbot into an agent | ~200 |
| 05 | [Permission Controls](./05-permission-controls/) | Three-tier safety model | Safety is a persistent allowlist, not a per-request prompt | ~250 |
| 06 | [Gateway](./06-gateway/) | HTTP + Telegram channels | The agent logic is channel-agnostic | ~300 |
| 07 | [Context Compaction](./07-context-compaction/) | Token mgmt + summarization | Summarize the old, keep the recent, never hit the limit | ~350 |
| 08 | [Long-Term Memory](./08-long-term-memory/) | File-based memory + search | Sessions remember conversations. Memory remembers knowledge | ~400 |
| 09 | [Concurrency & Scheduling](./09-concurrency-scheduling/) | Locks + cron tasks | Lock per session, schedule per task - the agent never sleeps | ~450 |
| 10 | [Multi-Agent Integration](./10-multi-agent-integration/) | Agent routing + full system | Specialize agents, share memory - that's collaboration | ~400 |

### What You'll Learn

- **The Bot Pattern** - How to wire an LLM to a messaging platform
- **Session Persistence** - Crash-safe conversation storage with JSONL
- **Agent Identity** - Designing personality and boundaries with system prompts
- **Tool Use & Agent Loops** - Giving an AI real-world capabilities
- **Safety & Permissions** - Building a three-tier command safety model
- **Multi-Channel Architecture** - Decoupling agent logic from delivery channels
- **Context Management** - Automatic summarization when context grows too large

- **Concurrency** - Per-session locking and scheduled background tasks
- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Specialized agents with shared memory

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- A [Telegram Bot Token](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) (talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))

### Setup

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

2.  **Configure environment**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
    ```

3.  **Run the first bot**:
    ```bash
    make 01-simplest-bot
    ```

make 04-tools-agent-loop      # + Tools and agent loop
make 05-permission-controls   # + Three-tier safety model
make 06-gateway               # + HTTP gateway alongside Telegram
make 07-context-compaction    # + Automatic context summarization
make 08-long-term-memory      # + File-based persistent memory

01 [Simplest Bot] ───────────> "An API call in a message handler"
    |                            ~20 lines, stateless
    v
02 [Persistent Sessions] ────> "JSONL is crash-safe persistence"
    |                            ~80 lines, multi-turn memory
    v
03 [Personality & Soul] ─────> "The system prompt IS identity"
    |                            ~90 lines, + SOUL.md
    v
04 [Tools & Agent Loop] ─────> "The loop makes it an agent"
    |                            ~200 lines, 4 tools
    v

    v
09 [Concurrency & Scheduling] > "Lock per session, schedule per task"
    |                            ~450 lines, threading + cron

10 [Multi-Agent Integration] ─> "Specialize and collaborate"
                                  ~400 lines, routing + full system
```

**Recommended approach:**
1. Read and run 01 first - understand the simplest possible bot
2. Compare 01 -> 02 - see how session persistence works
3. Study 03 for identity design patterns
4. Master 04 for the agent loop - this is the biggest jump
5. Explore 05-06 for safety and architecture
6. Study 07-08 for context and memory management
7. Explore 09-10 for production concerns and multi-agent systems

## Each Module Includes

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `bot.py` | The runnable bot code (or `mini-openclaw.py` in module 10) |
| `README.md` | Module intro, learning goals, how to run |
| `GUIDE.md` | Deep-dive explanation of concepts |
| `EXERCISES.md` | Hands-on exercises |

## The Core Pattern

Every persistent AI assistant is built on this foundation:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

def handle_message(user_id, text):
    messages = load_session(user_id)
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": text})

    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        system=SOUL,
        messages=messages,
    )

    assistant_msg = response.content[0].text
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_msg})
    save_session(user_id, messages)
    return assistant_msg
```

Load history, call the API, save the response. Everything else is refinement.

## Verifying Your Setup

```bash
make test    # Runs automated checks on all modules
```
